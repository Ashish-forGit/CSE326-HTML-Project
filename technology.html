        <h1><center>  <span style="color: blueviolet;">   TOP 14 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES </span></center></h1>
        <h2>1. Javascript</h2>
        <p><span style="color: blue;"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"> JavaScript</a></span> is a high-level programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. It is used as a client-side programming language by 97.8 percent of all websites. JavaScript was originally used only to develop web browsers, but they are now used for server-side website deployments and non-web browser applications as well. <br><br>

          Javascript was created in 1995 and was initially known as LiveScript. However, Java was a very popular language at that time, so it was advertised as a “younger brother” of Java. As it evolved over time, JavaScript became a fully independent language. Nowadays, JavaScript is often confused with Java, and although there are some similarities between them, the two languages are distinct.<br><br>
          
          Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and is in high demand among various organizations. The average Java developer earns around $112,152 each year.   </p> <br><br>     
        </p>

            <h2>4. Java</h2>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)"> Java</a> is one of the most popular programming languages used today. <br><br>

            Owned by Oracle Corporation, this general-purpose programming language with its object-oriented structure has become a standard for applications that can be used regardless of platform (e.g., Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, etc.) because of its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) capabilities. As a result, Java is recognized for its portability across platforms, from mainframe data centers to smartphones. Today there are more than 3 billion devices running applications built with Java. <br><br>
            
            Java is widely used in web and application development as well as big data. Java is also used on the backend of several popular websites, including Google, Amazon, Twitter, and YouTube. It is also extensively used in hundreds of applications. New Java frameworks like Spring, Struts, and Hibernate are also very popular. With millions of Java developers worldwide, there are hundreds of ways to learn Java. Also, Java programmers have an extensive online community and support each other to solve problems. <br><br>
            
            Java is a more complex language to learn, but experienced developers with Java coding skills are in high demand. The average Java developer earns around $109,225 each year. <br><br>
          </p> <br><br>

          <h2>5. Kotlin</h2>
          <p><a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin(programming_language)"> Kotlin</a> is a general-purpose programming language originally developed and unveiled as Project Kotlin by JetBrains in 2011. The first version was officially released in 2016. It is interoperable with Java and supports functional programming languages. <br><br>

            Kotlin is used extensively for Android apps, web application, desktop application, and server-side application development. Kotlin was built to be better than Java, and people who use this language are convinced. Most of the Google applications are based on Kotlin. Some companies using Kotlin as their programming language include Coursera, Pinterest, PostMates among many others. <br><br>
            
            Kotlin developers earn an average of $136,000 a year, with the potential to earn up to $171,500. </p> <br><br>

            <h2>6. PHP</h2>
            <p> <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP"> PHP</a>  is an open-source programming language created in 1990. Many web developers find it essential to learn PHP, as this language is used to build more than 80% of websites on the Internet, including notable sites like Facebook and Yahoo.<br><br>

              Programmers mainly use PHP mainly to write server-side scripts. But developers can also use this language to write command-line scripts, and programmers with high-level PHP coding skills can also use it to develop desktop applications.<br><br> 
              
              PHP is considered a relatively easy language to learn for beginning developers. PHP professionals have access to several dedicated online communities, making it easy to get support and answers to questions.<br><br>
              
              On average, PHP programmers earn average annual salaries of about $107,409.</p> <br><br>

              <h2>7. C#</h2>
              <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C#"> C#</a>,Developed by Microsoft, C# rose to fame in the 2000s for supporting the concepts of object-oriented programming. It is one of the most used programming languages for the .NET framework. Anders Hejlsberg, the creator of C#, says the language is more like C++ than Java. <br><br>

                C# is best suited for applications on Windows, Android, and iOS, as it takes the help of the integrated development environment product, Microsoft Visual C++. C# is used on the back end of several popular websites like Bing, Dell, Visual Studio, and MarketWatch. C# developers earn around $111,760 per year. </p><br><br>
               
                <h2>8. Swift</h2>
                <p> A few years ago,<a href="#swift">Swift</a> made the top 10 in the monthly TIOBE Index ranking of popular programming languages. Apple developed Swift in 2014 for Linux and Mac applications. <br><br>

                  An open-source programming language that is easy to learn, Swift supports almost everything from the programming language Objective-C. Swift requires fewer coding skills compared with other programming languages, and it can be used with IBM Swift Sandbox and IBM Bluemix. Swift is used in popular iOS apps like WordPress, Mozilla Firefox, SoundCloud, and even in the game Flappy Bird. 
                   <br> who develop iOS applications take home average annual salaries of around $106,652.</p> <br><br>
         
                   <h2>9. Ruby</h2>
                   <p>If you want to start with a language that is known for being relatively simple to learn, consider  <a href="#Ruby">Ruby</a>.   <br>
                     Developed in the 1990s, it was designed to have a more human-friendly syntax while still being flexible from the standpoint of its object-oriented architecture that supports procedural and functional programming notation. A web-application framework that is implemented in Ruby is Ruby on Rails (“RoR”). Ruby developers tout it for being an easy language to write in and also for the relatively short learning time required. These attributes have led to a large community of Ruby developers and a growing interest in the language among beginning developers. <br> The average salary for a Ruby developer is around $121,000 per year.</p> <br><br>

                    <h2>10. C and C++</h2>
                    <p>C is probably the oldest and popular programming language and is the root of other programming languages such as C#, Java, and JavaScript. C++ is an enhanced version of C. Many developers today skip learning C on its own, while others think learning C first provides a valuable foundation for C++ development. Both languages are widely used in computer science and programming. <br><br>

                      C and C++ developers can make use of compilers for a wide variety of platforms, making applications developed in these languages largely transportable. Both C and C++ are considered high-performance languages. As such, they are widely used in developing applications where performance is a critical issue, such as client/server applications, commercial products like Firefox and Adobe, and video games. C and C++ developers earn an average of $118,366 each year.</p> <br> <br>
