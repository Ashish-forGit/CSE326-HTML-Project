Details:-

The “Top 100 Blogs”- title of the report justify that my report will be on Blog based Website which was assigned by my CSE326 teacher. The main motive of the website is to provide  the user with top 100 things of  different subjects. So I have made the website stating the same. My blog website focusses on the top technologies, top web development tools, top best databases a web developer should know and top code editors a fresher should adapt with! We have also provide with a “Request for Blog” button in  the website where user can get the required blog as per their interest. Let’s start with the website description the first page is HOME page where user have following buttons Home, About, Contact me , Blog type (dropdown box), in the left side of the navigation bar and a search button, login and sign up button in the right side of the navigation bar.

At the bottom to the navigation bar there is moving carousel showing different pictures of the top technologies, top web development tools, top best databases a web developer should know and top code editors. In the carousel there is a specific buttons for all the top subject mentioned in the blog. Down to the carousel there is four rectangular box showing all the subjects and “continue reading” button clicking on which user can move to the required subject and read the required subject blog. At the extreme bottom there is a footer part of the website showing copyright trademark in right and different social handles of the admin where user can interact with the admin of the webpage and post there queries.
