        <p><em><strong>Let’s start!!</strong></em></p>
        <h2>Introduction :-</h2>
        <p style="font-size: medium;color: rgb(192, 9, 9);margin-left: 80px;">When listening to developers talk about
            databases you will
            usually hear buzz words like robust, scalable, efficient, etc. Discussions will focus on the power of the
            DBMS (DataBase Management System) and how it integrates with other technologies. In our case, however, we
            don’t really care about most of those things. Instead we are going to be looking at the cost of getting
            started, tools, the user interface and availability of help, especially help for the beginner. <br><br>

            In the list below we’ll talk briefly about each DBMS, give you some pros and cons, and show you how to
            download and get started with each of them.</p> <br> <br>


        <h3><span id="1_Webcom"><span style="color: #273532;">#1) </span>MySQL Community Server</span></h3>
        <p style="font-size: large;color: rgb(44, 20, 40);margin-left: 80px;"> This DBMS gets the number one nod
            mainly because the community version is free and is a great
            platform to begin learning on. There are, of course, commercial versions of MySQL for sale once you get
            to the point where you are developing large scale commercial applications, but getting started will cost
            you a big fat nothing. <br> <br>

            Initially MySQL was available on a small set of platforms, Linux for the most part. However, now you can
            put MySQL on pretty much anything that you can imagine including Linux, Mac and Windows. <br> <br>

            There is also a community version of their MySQL Workbench tool which gives the beginner a nice GUI
            (graphical user interface) to visually design and work with database tables. MySQL Workbench is
            reasonably intuitive, helps the beginner learn syntax by allowing the user to see syntax created by the
            tool when a task is designed, and has decent help documentation. Better than the actual help
            documentation you can find a ton of online tutorials, blogs, articles, etc. on developing in MySQL. </p>
        <br> <br>


        <h3><span id="1_Webcom"><span style="color: #ff6600;">#2) Microsoft Access </span></span></h3>
        <p style="font-size: large;color: rgb(44, 20, 40);margin-left: 80px;"> Unlike MySQL, Microsoft’s Access is
            not free. However, as it is part of Microsoft Office, many developers already have it. Even if you don’t use
            Microsoft Office you can still download a trial version of Access which will get you 60 days to play around
            with it and see if it is for you. <br> <br>

            Access does have some key similarities to MySQL. It lets you design a table or task visually and then see
            the syntax that gets created. There are also some good and not so good differences. On the good side Access
            doesn’t have two separate installations (one for the DBMS and one for the design tool) but rather all comes
            as a single application. On the down side, Access has some significant limitations. It’s not nearly as
            flexible on which operating systems it can be installed on. More significantly, it has a serious limitation
            in how many concurrent connections it can handle before performance degrades. What that means is that Access
            is ideal for learning and for low traffic hobbyist websites but becomes sluggish and unsuitable for websites
            that have moderate or heavier traffic. <br> <br>

            If you don’t already have Microsoft Office you can download the trial </p>
        <br> <br>


        <h3><span id="1_Webcom"><span style="color: #ff6600;">#3) Microsoft SQL Server Express </span></span></h3>
        <p style="font-size: large;color: rgb(44, 20, 40));margin-left: 80px;"> With this DBMS and the next two, we
            step up to the big boys. Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle and DB2 are the most popular of the major DBMS’s. They
            each have separate design tools and server applications that must be installed. <br> <br>

            In truth, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Express and DB2 Express are all very similar in tools and
            functionality. Their biggest differences lie in the syntax of their SQL, therefore, they are not really
            listed in any particular order. The Microsoft SQL Server option does have one drawback in that the operating
            systems it will run on are limited.

            <br> <br>

            You can download Microsoft SQL Server Express for free.
        </p>
        <br> <br>

        <h3><span id="1_Webcom"><span style="color: #ff6600;">#4) Oracle Express Edition</span></span></h3>
        <p style="font-size: large;color: rgb(44, 20, 40));margin-left: 80px;"> Oracle Express also has tools and a
            separate server application. It also has more operating system options than Microsoft SQL Server Express.
            The download options are also much more abundant than the others in this list. But all the download info you
            really need to get started can be found here.

            <br> <br>

            You can download Oracle Express Edition for free.
        </p>
        <br> <br>


        <h3><span id="1_Webcom"><span style="color: #ff6600;">#5) DB2 Express-C </span></span></h3>
        <p style="font-size: large;color: rgb(44, 20, 40);margin-left: 80px;"> The install options and supported OSes of
            DB2 Express-C are very similar to those of Oracle Express. Online tutorials, articles and examples, however,
            are not as abundant as the other options in this list but are still more than adequate.

            <br> <br>

            You can also download DB2 Express-C to get started.

    <div class="extra" style="background-color: #a8a7f0;">

        <h1 style="display: flex;">So, Which One Do I Choose?</h1>
        <p> When deciding where to start I suggest you go through a simple series of common sense questions:
            <br><br>
        <p style="font-size: large;color: rgb(44, 20, 40);margin-left: 80px;">
            <u> 1).Are you learning SQL for work?</u> <br><br>
            If you are learning SQL for work, for example, you will be best served selecting the same DBMS that you
            use
            at work. By selecting the same DBMS that you use at work you will save yourself much pain and suffering
            with
            SQL syntax confusion when you start doing actual development.
        </p> <br> <br>


        <p style="font-size: large;color: rgb(44, 20, 40);margin-left: 80px;">
            <u>
                2). Are you learning SQL with or for a web development technology like PHP or ASP.NET? </u> <br> <br>
            If you are learning SQL to use with a web development technology then you will find that your life will be
            much easier if you select a DBMS that is either created by or made to work with your web technology of
            choice. For example, ASP.NET developers will usually select Microsoft SQL Server or Microsoft Access, PHP
            developers will usually choose MySQL or Oracle, and Java/WebSphere developers will usually select DB2.
        </p> <br> <br>

        <p style="font-size: large;color: rgb(44, 20, 40);margin-left: 80px;">
            <u>
                3). Are you learning just to expand your brain? </u> <br> <br>
            If none of the questions above really apply to you I would suggest you choose either MySQL or Microsoft
            Access as they have good user interfaces and great online content.
        </p> <br> <br> <br>

        <h3><span id="1_Webcom"><span style="color: #273532;"> </span>Conclusion :- </span></h3> <br>
        <p style="display: flex; color: rgb(11, 30, 48); font-size: larger; padding-bottom: 50px; padding-left: 40px; ">
            Getting started
            with database development is not nearly as hard as it used to be. As you can see above, all
            major DBMS producers offer a free version of their enterprise products. That means the cost to get started
            is pretty much whatever it is going to cost you for some books. You could even avoid that cost by surfing
            through the tons of tutorials, examples and references available on the internet.</p> <br>
